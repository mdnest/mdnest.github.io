If you use public transit frequently then you probably encountered this thought:

> I just showed up at the bus stop, and I'm not sure when the next bus is coming, but there are a lot of people here waiting, so it is probably soon!

As it turns out, the probabilistic intuition that justifies this idea makes good use of Bayes' theorem! So, let's set up a mathematical model of waiting on the bus and see how Bayes' theorem help us.

# Simulating wait times

In order to provide evidence for our claim, let's simulate the times which you enter the bus station. We can assume the time since the last bus departed the station upon your arrival is uniformly distributed between 0 and 30 minutes (since buses come every 30 minutes). Let's simulate a large number of bus stop encounters, namely ten million of them.


```python
import numpy as np

N = 10**7  # Number of samples
t_max = 30  # Minutes between bus arrivals 

enter_station_times = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=t_max, size=N)
```

As expected, if buses arrive every 30 minutes and you show up at random, then your average wait time is 15 minutes:


```python
waiting_times = t_max - enter_station_times
waiting_times.mean()
```




    14.998467376009872



Now, let's generate another random sample which simulates the number of riders you observe waiting on the bus when you enter the station. For this task, a *Poisson process* is the most appropriate model. Without going into details, if you agree with the following assumptions:
- Riders arrive independently of one another
- Riders arrive at the station with an average rate of $\lambda$ riders per minute

then the process of arrival must be a Poisson process. Let's assume for the sake of this problem that $\lambda=1/10$, meaning that, on average, one rider enters the station every 10 minutes.


```python
lam = 1/10  # Rate of passenger arrival

num_riders = np.random.poisson(lam*enter_station_times, size=N)
```

We already calculate that the average waiting time before observing how many riders are waiting at the station is 15 minutes. Now let's perform this same calculation, assuming we have observed 3 riders at the station:


```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame(data={'waiting_time': t_max - enter_station_times,
                          'num_riders': num_riders})

data[data.num_riders == 3]['waiting_time'].mean()
```




    9.050032556437035



A-ha! Now we should only expect to wait 9 minutes. In fact, as the number of riders increases (to infinity), we should expect that our expected waiting time should decrease to zero.


```python
X = np.arange(10)

average_wait_times = [data[data.num_riders == x]['waiting_time'].mean() for x in X]
```


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('seaborn')

plt.bar(X,height=average_wait_times,alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Number of riders')
plt.ylabel('Average wait time')
plt.show()
```

# The posterior distribution

We can see from our simulation that the expected wait time is lower when we arrive several riders waiting at the station. To derive the mathematical formula of the expected wait time, we need to calculate what is known as the *posterior distribution* of the expected wait time given the number of riders waiting at the station.

First, we need to specify the prior distribution on the time $t$ that we enter the station. This is given by a uniform distribution, with PDF given by:

$$ p(t) = \frac{1}{30}, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 30 $$

Next, the parametric distribution tells us the probability distribution on the number of passengers $x$, given the time that we entered the station. For a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$, the expected number of riders waiting at the station should be $\lambda t$. Its PDF is given by

$$ p(x|t) = \frac{(\lambda t)^x e^{-\lambda t}}{x!}, \quad x=0,1,2,\dots $$

The parametric distribution $p(x\vert t)$ gives us the probability distribution of the number of riders in the station based on the time we, the observer, entered the station. But we want to go the opposite way, and develop a probabibility distribution of the time we entered the station (which is unknown to us) based on the number of riders we observe. This is exactly what is accomplished by Bayes' formula when it gives us the posterior distribution $p(t\vert x)$:

$$ p(t|x) = \frac{p(x|t)p(t)}{p(x)} = \frac{p(x|t)p(t)}{\int p(x|t) p(t) \, dt} $$

Substituting the distributions from this problem and cancelling some terms, we obtain:

$$ p(t|x) = \frac{t^x e^{-\lambda t}}{\int_{0}^{30} t^x e^{-\lambda t} \, dt } $$

The integral in the denominator does not have a (simple) closed-form expression, but it is enough to write into a Python function:


```python
from scipy import integrate

def posterior(t,x):
    parametric = lambda t : t**x * np.exp(-lam*t)
    I, err = integrate.quad(func=parametric, a=0, b=30)
    return t**x * np.exp(-lam*t) / I

posterior = np.vectorize(posterior)
```

# Bayes estimator of the waiting time

With the posterior in hand, let's view the distribution of wait times given that we observe $x=2$ riders at the station.


```python
plt.plot(posterior(np.arange(30), x=2))
plt.xlabel('Time of bus station entry')
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.show()
```

As we might expect, the *median* of this distribution is $t=20$ minutes, since riders arriving at a rate of 1 rider per 10 minutes are most likely to produce 2 riders after 20 minutes. But we are interested in the *mean* of this distribution:

$$ E[t|x] = \int_{0}^{30} t p(t|x) \, dt $$


```python
def expected_waiting_time(x):
    f = lambda t : t * posterior(t,x)
    I, err = integrate.quad(func=f, a=0, b=30)
    return t_max - I

expected_waiting_time = np.vectorize(expected_waiting_time)
```

Let's compute the expected wait time, given that we observed 3 riders at the station:


```python
expected_waiting_time(x=3)
```




    array(9.05289627)



Great! Now let's view the plot of wait times for all possible number of riders upon arriving at the bus station:


```python
plt.bar(np.arange(10),height=average_wait_times,alpha=0.5,label='simulation')
plt.plot(expected_waiting_time(X),'o',color='black',label='posterior prediction')
plt.xlabel('Observed number of riders')
plt.ylabel('Expected wait time')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

# Conclusion

This concludes the analysis of bus stop arrival times. Next time when you arrive at the bus station and see a large group of people waiting, you can feel confident that the bus will come a little sooner than you initially expected!
